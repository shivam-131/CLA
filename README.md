This is a repository for implementing the temporal memory algorithm on the New York Yellow Taxi Data. Two metrics for accuracy have been evaluated namely MSE and cross entropy loss. The package used in nupic, which has been developed by Numenta- a neuroscience-machine intelligence think tank which also developed these algorithms.

The data I used is Yellow Taxi Trip data from the January 1st, 2020 to January 31st, 2020.
I have each day into 48 slots of 30 mminutes each. And the proecessed csv has been uploaded here. Each slot has the corresponding count of passengers travelling in it.
